# 🚗 Rental Car System – Web Application

Welcome to the **Rental Car System** project! This repository outlines the design and functionality of a rental car booking website for a fictional company (Company X). The platform will serve as both a customer-facing storefront and an administrative backend for company staff.

---

## 📖 Scenario

This web application will simulate the operations of a rental car company. It acts as an **online storefront** where customers can browse, search, and reserve rental cars. Additionally, employees of the company will have access to tools for managing the vehicle listings and bookings.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this project is twofold:
1. **Customer Interface**  
   - Search for available rental cars  
   - Filter cars by attributes (e.g., size, type, price, availability)  
   - Reserve cars online  

2. **Admin Interface**  
   - Add, edit, and remove vehicle listings  
   - Change car availability status  
   - Manage bookings and customer data  

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Target Audience

The platform is designed for:
- International travelers visiting the country  
- Large families traveling together  
- People temporarily without access to their personal vehicle  
- Individuals who need a different vehicle type for specific purposes (e.g., moving)  
- Users from overseas or without long-term car ownership

---

## 🗃️ Data Model

The system will use a **relational database** consisting of 7 primary tables:
1. `UserType` – defines roles (e.g., admin, customer)  
2. `User` – stores user credentials and personal info  
3. `CarType` – categories of cars (e.g., SUV, sedan, van)  
4. `CarDescription` – detailed specs for each vehicle  
5. `Rental` – tracks all reservations  
6. `CarAvailability` – current availability status  
7. `UserDescription` – extended user profile data

**Figure 1** (ER diagram) illustrates the relationships between these tables.

## 🌐 Website Structure

The web app will consist of the following pages:
- **Home Page** – Introduction and navigation  
- **Car Listings Page** – Browse/search/filter rental cars  
- **About Us Page** – Company background and mission  
- **Contact Page** – Address, phone, email, and feedback form

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend/Backend IDE**: Visual Studio 2022  
- **Database**: SQL Server Management Studio 19  
- **Languages/Frameworks**: *(To be finalized during development)*  
  Likely: C#, ASP.NET Core MVC, HTML/CSS, JavaScript  

---

## 📌 Development Notes

- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile use  
- Focus on clean UX for both customers and employees  
- Admin panel access restricted based on user roles
